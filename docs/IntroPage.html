						The basic definition of relational dialectics has a few
						components. First, that the words and phrases we use
						inherently carry meaning, and that second, the meaning applied
						to those words by people may be different from person to
						person. Furthermore, when two parties have a conversation, the
						words and phrases are not said in a random order, but instead
						we might first exchange a greeting before talking about how we
						feel, or something going on in your life.
