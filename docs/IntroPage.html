						The basic definition of relational dialectics has a few
						components. First, that the words and phrases we use
						inherently carry meaning, and that second, the meaning applied
						to those words by people may be different from person to
						person. Furthermore, when two parties have a conversation, the
						words and phrases are not said in a random order, but instead
						we might first exchange a greeting before talking about how we
						feel, or something going on in your life. Also, there isn't
						necessarily a strict structure that conversations must follow,
						there is a flow that can be traced from response to repsonse.
						RDT states that it is important to examine each individual
						response in the context of that conversation flow.

						Dr. Leslie Baxter, in their paper
						<em> Relational DialecticsTheory </em>
						listed these three things (words have meaning, people apply
						differnt meanings to words, responses occur within the context
						of the flow of a conversation) as the first three primary
						tenets of RDT. In that same paper, Baxter further states that
						"
						<em>Fourth, discourses are rarely on equal footing</em>
						meaning systems typically have unequal power in the
						meaning-making process. Prior meanings function as semantic
						precedents for current and future meaning-making. Thus,
						meaning-making is less a semantic democracy and more a
						struggle among semantic unequals: the centered, often
						taken-for-granted meaning system inherited from the utterance
						chain and alternative, more marginalized meaning systems"
						(Baxter).

						Baxter further goes on to say "Although individual persons,
						groups, or institutions might invoke particular discourses, it
						is the power held by dominant discourses that affords greater
						voice-influence and understanding—to some individuals and
						groups over others who voice less dominant, muted discourses"
						(Baxter). Basically what Dr. Baxter is explaining is that in
						any given dicourse, it is rare that any two parties involved
						in the discourse will have equivalent "power", and thus
						certain individuals will have a larger pull on the direction
						of the flow of the conversation.
