					<p>
						RDT has a large role in romantic relationships, and many
						couples would benefit from having a better understanding from
						some of the central concepts related to RDT.
					</p>

					<p>
						For example, it is extremely important for people in a
						relationship to be communicating properly with each other in
						order to make sure that the other person is still happy and
						satisfied. Knowing to be open about your feelings with your
						partner is an extremely valuable skill. This is tied to
						openness and closedness.
					</p>

					<p>
						In the context of sameness versus change, many couples have
						reported succesful rekindlings of stale relationships after
						introducing a new element to their relationship, whether it be
						making extra time for your partner, or spicing things up.
