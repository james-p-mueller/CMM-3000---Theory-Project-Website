						“in friendships, however, people may satisfactorily juggle
						casual friendships and closer friendships, and many
						friendships may never develop deep levels of intimacy” “levels
						of friendships, such as casual, close, and best. Relationships
						are also able to oscillate between these levels and exhibit
						spiraling change, where tendencies recur continually but not
						in an identical fashion” “amount of contact was less important
						and affection was more important in closer friendships. Casual
						friendships were more likely to end due to lack of proximity,
						whereas close and best friendships were more likely to end due
						to decreased affection.”
