						“Social penetration theory describes relationship development
						through stages and provides a number of predictions (framed in
						terms of resources, cost, benefits, and outcomes) about
						movement among stages. Conversely, the Staircase Model
						provides a description of relationship stages, and does not
						develop clear predictions concerning movement among stages.”

					<p>
						“Social Penetration theory because it focuses on the process
						of self disclosure of personal information as people become
						acquainted. Based on this theory the researcher might argue
						that there are various kinds of information that a person can
						reveal about his or her occupation and that this information
						can vary in its superficiality or depth.”
