					<p>
						RDT plays a role in each of our lives even as college
						students. Students are always operating under multiple and
						unique stressors, whether it be assignments, work, finding an
						internship, etc. These are just a few of the standout examples
						that were easiest to point to. The development of friendships
						is a fundamental and important part of a succesful college
						experience, so understanding more about how our environment
						influences the choices we make is very important.
