					<p>
						RDT plays a role in each of our lives even as college
						students. Students are always operating under multiple and
						unique stressors, whether it be assignments, work, finding an
						internship, etc. These are just a few of the standout examples
						that were easiest to point to. The development of friendships
						is a fundamental and important part of a succesful college
						experience, so understanding more about how our environment
						influences the choices we make is very important.
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>Privacy VS Connection:</em> Finding a balance between
						work, classes, and having a social life can be hard. Many
						college students spend nights out having fun growing their
						social connections as well as maintaining their social health.
						We also need some nights to ourselves, as we need to rest and
						recover.
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>Sameness VS Change:</em> During the first few weeks of
						everyone's college experience, we all looked for new people to
						spend time with and things to do, whether it was on campus or
						not. Usually after a certain amount of time, people settled
						into their friendships and relationships and tended to
						socialize primarily with them. At the beginining of each new
						semester as we meet new people, this group of people would
						grow, shrink, and change.
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>Openeness VS Closedness:</em> People will decide to
						disclose certain things about themselves depending on who they
						are with and other circumstances as well. Certain topics of
						conversation may come up depending on what class you are in.
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>Involvement VS Distance:</em> We choose to spend our time
						with certain people and doing certain activities. many college
						students find a new interest or group of people to spend time
						with through thier classes or clubs. This is an active choice
						that we make.
