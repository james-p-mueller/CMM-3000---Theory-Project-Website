					<p>
						RDT is still a developing idea in the communications because
						of the complex nature of human relationships. As each
						individual will have unique conceptions going into any given
						interaction, it is extremely hard to create a "control" for
						studying RDT.
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>
						One leading researcher in the field of RDT is Dr. Suter. In a
						paper published in the Journal of Family Communication called
						<em>
							Charting a Research Agenda for Relational Dialectics
							Theory: Forwarding Critical Theorizing in Interpersonal and
							Family Communication Research
						</em>
						suggests that "Advancements might also be made by putting RDT
						in conversation with other contemporary critical theoretical
						developments... [two studies] Sacs (2023), and Tian (2024)
						serve as two recent examples. Sachs... merits recognition
						again given its integration of queer theorizing and RDT.
						Likewise, Tian integrates RDT with new materialist
						perspectives. Using both RDT and agential realism theory as
						heuristics, Tian analyzes intersecting occupational, gender,
						and familial identities of Chinese female entrepreneurs."
						(Suter 189).

					<p>
						There are still hundreds of avenues with which RDT needs to be
						explored, Suter themself pointing to two previous studies to
						use as guideposts for future researchers of RDT. Factors such
						sexuality, gender identity, race, class, occupation, and many
						other factors all need to be explored to greater degrees.
						Given how the unique identities of those involved in any given
						study of RDT will innevitabley influence the results of the
						study to some extent inherently, it is still important to
						study the way these factors intermingle.
